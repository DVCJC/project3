<p>On December 24th, 2001. It was a cold night and streets were shut down do to pouring rain. Five year old Little Wesley was eagerly awaiting for Santa by the chimney when his mom urged him to go to bed when there was a loud knocking at the door. 

“It’s Santa! It’s gotta be Santa mommy!” young Wesley said with an enthusiastic yelp. 

“Maybe,” said Jennifer Ezell Wesley’s mother. She opened up the door to find a cop at the door. Wesley was disappointed that it wasn’t who he expected. Jennifer asks the cop what is going on. 

“Mrs. Ezell is it?” asked the cop. 

“Yes, that’s me what’s going on?” 

“Mrs. Ezell you might want to take a seat.” 

“Okay. Wesley go to your room while I talk to the police officer.” 

A few minutes pass when Wesley comes out of his room to find his mother in a pool of her own tears. He walks over to his mother and she hugs him tightly. 

“Wesley I love you so much.” said a distraught Jennifer. 

“I love you too mom.” said a confused Wesley. They sit there for a minute embracing each other when Wesley says “Mommy. When is daddy going to get home?” 

“ Oh, Weasley. Poor poor Wesley.” said a choked up Jennifer 

“Your father won’t be coming home. He is dead.” Wesley’s life changed forever.</p> 

<p>The year is 2012 on Earth N4-11. Wesley is 17 years old and is a social misfit. Ever since his father’s death, he has isolated himself from society. In therapy, he doesn’t express any emotion, but inside there is a deep rage sitting, steaming, boiling, just waiting to be set off. Wesley lives with his mother and Dean his step dad. Wesley strongly resents his stepfather feeling that he could never replace his father. Wesley has had countless run-ins with the law. One day Wesley decides to steal his father’s Ferrari and tear up the streets of San Leandro. The police begin to chase after him. Wesley likes a challenge so he speeds up and starts to try to outdrive the police. One thing to make note of about the city of San Leandro is that is packed. Narrow streets and sharp turns are not meant to be driven on at such high speeds. Wesley’s driving ends with multiple car crashes and tons of city damage. He is eventually stopped when a helicopter sniper shoots one of the front wheels on the car. Wesley spins out and crashes into a wall. He is okay and only has a few scratches. He stumbles out of the broken vehicle to see cops surrounding him with guns to his head. 

“Get down on the ground with your hands behind your head!!!” yelled multiple officers. 

“Go ahead shoot me what do I care!!!” screamed an obviously intoxicated Wesley. “I’ll just join my father in the gutter slowly bleeding out,” Wesley says solemnly. He drops to his knees and covers his tear soaked eyes and cries out “Why me. Why me. What did I do to deserve this life.” Wesley raises his hands towards the officers “Go ahead end my misery.” 

An officer cuffs Wesley and stuffs him in the back of a patrol car. A few hours later Dean arrives at the station to bail Wesley out of jail. The police chief pulls Dean to the side to talk about Wesley. 

“Look, Dean, I know you’ve done a lot of good for this city and all, but we can’t keep releasing this degenerate back out on streets endangering innocent people’s lives. It’s just not in good conscious to keep releasing him.” 

“I completely understand Joe and I will take care of it. He won’t be causing any more trouble here. I promise.” said Dean. Wesley is released and he and Dean are driving home. 

“Tell me. What is wrong with you? WHAT IN THE ABSOLUTE F**K IS WRONG WITH YOU WESLEY EZELL?!!” Wesley doesn’t answer. 

“You know when I first meet you where a sweet little child, but NOW you’re an INGRATE an absolute DISGRACE to me and your mother. Do you know how much she worries about you?” Wesley still doesn’t respond. 

“God***mit Wesley, can’t you see you’re headed down the same path as your father?” 

“Don’t you talk about him. You keep his name out of your filthy mouth. You never knew him.” yelled an agitated Wesley. 

“Like you did.” snapped Dean. Silence fell over the car. 

“I’m sorry Wes, but you just don’t know stubborn you are. That’s why we’re sending you away.” 

“What!” exclaimed Wesley 

“Mom agreed to this?” 

“I said “we’re” didn’t I. Look we both came to the decision that it would be in your best interest that you leave this place. There are a lot of bad memories here for you and we thought it would be best if you left this all behind you. You’ll be going to Japan and staying with one of my closest friends.” Wesley sinks into his seat and stares out the window observing the surroundings that will soon become foreign to him.</p> 

<p>Two weeks later Wesley was on a plane headed to Japan. After 14 hours he reaches Japan. When gets off the plane he sees a man holding a sign that says Wesley Ezell on it. Wesley puts his bags in the trunk of the car and slumps in the back seat. They ride in silence for a while when Kazuaki breaks the silence. 

“So you are the Komatta ko.” 

“What’s a Komatta ko?” asked Wesley with a confused face. 

“It means troubled child.” answers Kazuaki 

“Hmm... well that’s the nicest thing anyone has called me in a while,” Wesley says with smirk 

“You know what I think?” asked Kazuaki. 

“I think your not so much troubled as you are misguided. You lost your father at a young age yes?” inquired Kazuaki. 

“Yes, he was killed when I was five.” acknowledged Wesley. 

“You never had a father figure to help guide and mold you into a success.” 

“I had Dean.” Wesley retorted.  

“Oh, Dean doesn’t know the first thing about raising a child. He only knows how to take care of himself. You need someone who can teach you discipline and control. That’s where I come in. I’ll be for lack of a better term rehabilitating you teaching you life lessons and stuff.” 

“That’s great and all mister but when do I get to go back home?” Wesley requested 

“They didn’t tell you? You can’t go home they’ve ostracized you.” 

“WHAT!!” Wesley exclaimed 

“They can’t do that. Can they?” Wesley asked. 

“Oh, they can with as many crimes as you’ve committed your lucky your not rotting in prison,” Kazuaki answered 

“F**k,” said Wesley with a sorrow filled tone. 

“F**k indeed Komatta ko.” Kazuaki acknowledged. 

“Can you please stop calling me that?” asked Wesley. 

“Sure. How bout Haisha instead” chuckled Kazuki 

“Now that is a cool name. What does it mean?” 

“Loser,” said Kazuaki as he burst into laughter. 

“Give me a break,” said Wesley as he drifted off to sleep.</p> 

<p>The next morning Kazuaki poured a bucket of freezing cold water over Wesley. 

“JEEESSSUUUUSSSS!!!!” Wesley screeched 

“What the hell was that for?” A freezing Wesley asked. 

“It’s training time. You’ve had enough sleep.” exclaimed Kazuaki with a joyous expression on his face. 

“What training?” asked a still soaking wet Wesley. 

“I’ll be teaching you the ancient martial arts style of Bādosutairu” 

“Ba-do-su what now?” 

“As far as you're concerned it is called Bird Style.” “Bird style what are you going to do teach me how to fly?” 

“Yes, but that comes much later in training.” They walk for five miles when they reach a forest on the northwestern flank of Mount Fuji. 

“What is this place?” Wesley asked Kazuaki 

“Aokigahara. The Suicide Forest.” 

“The what?”Wesley asked as goosebumps rise on his skin. 

“The Suicide Forest. One of the most haunted places on Earth. You are going to show your mental fortitude by escaping the forest. I want to see how far you’ll push yourself to survive.” 

“Are you kidding me you crazy old----.” Kazuaki knocks Wesley out with chloroform and drags him in the forest. A few hours later Wesley wakes up in the middle of the forest. 

He goes from scared “Oh sweet Jesus help me.” 

To pessimistic “This is it. I’m going to die.” 

To paranoid “What was that?” 

He climbs up a tree because he thought he saw something run in the woods. He turns his head to be face to face with a rotting corpse. 

“AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH.” screamed Wesley as he fell out the tree onto the ground knocking himself out.

 	He wakes up and decides he won’t die this way and tries to find a way out. Wesley takes his father’s golden compass out and tries to use it to figure out which way he should go. Unfortunately for Wesley the magnetic field in the forest tampered with the compass and made it virtually useless. He looked to the sky and could barely see the sun. He could see enough to make out where east and west was. That helped a lot on his quest to reach civilization. After three hours of straight walking, Wesley made it out of the forest bloody, dirty, and defeated to find Kazuaki sitting on a bench eating a California Roll. Wesley takes a seat next to Kazuaki.</p> 

<p>“So. How was it?” Kazuaki asked 

“How was it? It was F**king awful. I’ve never felt so vulnerable, desperate, and lonely before. What kind of lesson was that? You almost got me killed you crazy psychopath.” 

“Hmmm. I want you to remember that feeling Wesley. The feeling of despair, loneliness, and desperation. You were so close to death, but you still didn’t give up. Instead, you pushed thru and proved to me and most importantly to yourself that you are capable of things much greater than you.” 

“I suppose I did.”</p>

<p>Over the next few years, Wesley trained in the art of  Bādosutairu. He has become very proficient in the ancient fighting style. He just needed to complete one last part of his training flying. 

“Today is the day you learn to fly my Gakusei,” Kazuaki said 

“Aw man, I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time. So how does this work? Do I just jump off the roof and let the natural forces carry me or do I use some kind of mystical spell to give me the ability?” Wesley asked eagerly. 

“God no. Nothing that ridiculous,” said Kazuaki hysterically as he opened up an old chest. He pulls a garment of some kind and hands it over to Wesley. 

“Spandex. Really?” 

“That isn’t spandex idiot it is a suit made out of a material called symbiote. It can tear but never stay torn and it heals the person wearing it. A true masterpiece one of a kind. Put it on.” A few minutes later Wesley comes out with the suit on. 

“It’s kind of tight.” Wesley moaned 

“You’ll get used to it. One thing I forgot to tell you is that your suit connects with you.” 

“What do you mean by connects with you?” Wesley asked 

“You become part of the suit and the suit becomes part of you. Be careful because the suit will try to use your emotion to cloud your judgment leading to fatal decisions. Trust me I’ve seen it first hand.” 

“Whoa! What is going on?” Wesley yelled. The suit started to change colors. The suit went from steel blue to carbon black. 

“Don’t worry the suit is just conforming to your personality. Originally it was set for a blue jay, but now it has shifted to Karasu. You will now be known as The Raven.”</p> 

<p>“So why did it pick a Raven?” asked Wesley while Kazuaki and him were eating lunch. 

“You sure do ask a lot of questions Wesley,” Kazuaki retorted 

“Well it is a lot to process.” 

“Anyways the suit chose raven because you and the raven are very similar. The raven is very antisocial like you. You have the confidence of a raven and your flight is just as graceful.” 

“Thank you. See how easily confusion is cleared up when you just answer the question.” Wesley said pertness 

“If you keep talking smart I’ll throw you back in that forest at night.” said Kazuaki jokingly.</p>

<p>When Kazuaki thought Wesley was ready they started fighting crime in the city named Hanzai Toshi. One day Wesley picks up a newspaper and smiles as he reads the headline. EXTRA! EXTRA! Washi (The Eagle) returns with new sidekick being called Karasu. The news article reads.</p>

<h2>At 12:30 a.m on the morning of June 15th, 2015 a strange phenomenon occurred. All the night owls looked to the sky to see two streaks in the air. The first streak was a familiar sight. It’s gold and white mist glistened in the dark night. Us at the office have deduced that the golden streak belonged to the fabled hero Washi. It has been twelve long years since the incident that put Washi out of commission, but that wasn’t the only surprise last night. People were shocked to see a second streak in the sky. This mist was harder to see with the dark sky for a background, but locals described the streak as a grayish metallic mist. Many are wondering if we have a new Naitou~otchā (Nightwatcher). It looks that Washi has found a protege to take his place. We will keep the public updated as more information comes thru.</h2>

<p>Wesley walks into the kitchen and sits at the dinner table across from Kazuaki. 

“Hey Kazuaki I was reading this paper and it said something about you having an accident. If don’t mind me asking what happened?”
Kazuaki put his soup to the side prepared to relive that horrible day.

“It was a terrible day that happened many many years ago.”

“Twelve years ago.” Wesley interrupted

“Right twelve years ago. I was trying to take down this drug dealer named Hanz Itami that had been eluding me for many years. I cornered him and his gang of thugs at a warehouse near the docks. I surprised them and thought I had the upper hand, but Hanz was always one step ahead of me. He revealed that he had kidnapped my wife she was taped to a number of explosives. I could take off the suit or I could walk away from this life and never return. I chose to put this life behind me. As I was untying my wife... “ Kazuaki stops as he tried to hold back his tears. He continues

 “While I was untying her the Bastard said something.”

“Now did you really believe that I’d let you walk outta here without some kind of payback? After all the trouble you put me thru. All of the money I have lost due to your actions. It is time that you lose something due to my actions.”

“Then he raised up a trigger. I looked at my wife’s face one last time and analyzed every detail. The fear, sorrow, tears, and pain of knowing she will soon be dead. Then the bomb went off. It blew me out of the warehouse and into the ocean. I washed up on shore. I decided from that point on that I would never wear the suit again. Then you came along and I saw this as the perfect opportunity to get back in action because to be honest I was sick and tired of seeing this city go to hell.”

“Wow I’m so sorry for your loss. Do you know what happened to that Hanz guy?” Wesley asked

“As far as I’m concerned he’s as dead as dirt.”</p>

<h3>In a secret hideout somewhere...</h3> 

<p>Hanz lays down the newspaper. “So Washi still lives. Man I thought he was dead as dirt. And it seems he has some help now. Well so do I. Isn’t that right son?”

“You betcha dad. It’s time to end this once and for all” Kota said as he flicked his butterfly knife back and forth.</p>

<h3>Wesley is training on the rooftop</h3>

<p>“So Kazuaki are there any other Masters of Bādosutairu?” Wesley asked as he was doing a horizontal handstand on the edge of the roof. 

“Yes, there were many of us. We even had our own temple” Kazuaki answered

“Were?”

“Yes there were many before the great war. The battle between Tochi (Land) and Kūki (Air).”

“That seems like a pretty big deal. How did this war not get picked up on by the commoners?”Wesley asked while doing vertical handstand push-ups.

“To the commoners it just looked like a big firework display. Lights and sounds shooting and crackling all throughout the night.”

“How many died?” 

“A few thousand. The Kūki won and the art of Dōbutsu no sutairu(Animal Style) was lost in time. The few masters who survived the far died a few years later due to injuries sustained from the war. So as far as I know me and you are the last practitioners of Bādosutairu.”

“Well that sucks. So us two are the only thing keeping this art from going extinct?” 

“That is correct.”

“Man that’s heavy.”</p>


	<h3>A few weeks later...</h3>
<p>“I think it’s time.” Kazuaki says to Wesley

“Time for what?” Wesley asked

“It’s time for you to fight on your own. I won’t be around forever and you need to be able to act on your instincts, not mine.” 

“Okay, so what is my mission?”

“I want you to take out this local gangster that has been causing a bit of trouble in Tokyo. He sent a threatening letter challenging us. It’s nothing too difficult just some two-bit gangster looking to make a name for himself. This is your chance to show what you can do on your own.”

“Alright I’ll do it.”</p>

	<p>Wesley suits up and flies to Tokyo. Thirty minutes later Wesley lands on a building adjacent from the gangster’s hideout. Wesley jumps onto the roof of the hideout and turns his X-ray vision on to look on the inside of the building. He sees five thugs sitting around a table with a pile of money on top of it. Wesley pulls out a circular device and places it on the roof. The device allows Wesley to hear what his happening below him.

“Aha hahaha hahahaha!!” The gangsters whooped, as they shuffled the money around.

“This has to be the easiest Ten grand I’ve ever earned” One gangster shouted.

“All for telling a little lie” Another yelped.

“Little lie?” Wesley asked to himself with intrigue.

“Those stupid heroes. They’re going to be in for a rude awakening when Han gets done with them.” One of the gangsters says with a sly look on his face.

“Han!!” Wesley says to himself
Wesley sprays a circle around him with a white foam and sets it on fire. 

BOOOOOMMMMM!!! 

The ceiling falls on top of the gangsters and Karasu springs into action. Karasu dodges a punch and throws one gangster into another. He grabs one of the gangsters and holds him as a human shield.

With his voice changer on Karasu says “WHAT ARE HAN’S PLANS!!!”

“Don’t tell him nothing he won’t harm Billy his kind doesn’t kill.” A gang member said.

“Oh really?” Karasu says.

He then takes his razor sharp wing and cuts off Billy’s arm and throws him out a window. The remaining gangsters were so shocked about what they saw that they reacted late to Karasu’s next attack. Karasu tackles two gang members and stabs one in the neck leaving him to bleed out on the floor. He picks the other one up and drags him towards the broken window that he threw Billy out of. Karasu grabs some steel wire and slowly wraps it around the gangster’s neck slowly choking him.

“What’s Han planning to do?” Karasu says angrily as he tightens his grip on the wire.

“Go to HELL. I’m not telling you Jack S**T!” The gangster says before spitting on Karasu’s mask.

“I don’t have time for this. TELL ME!! I can make your death slow and agonizing or quick and painless. Your choice.”

Karasu tightens his grip and pushes him against the window sill. The gang member’s back is slowly cut open from the constant grinding against the broken glass from the broken window. The pain finally gets to the gangster.

“Alright I’ll tell you!!” The gangster yelps while still being choked.

“So what’s the plan?”Karasu asks as he slowly releases the tension on the steel cable. 

“The plan was to lure you and your partner over here so Han could destroy your hideout. They are going to bomb the place.”

“What? Don’t they know innocent people with families live in that same building?”

“Cold-hearted bastards like them don’t care who's in their way as long as they accomplish their goal.”

“I have to warn Kazuaki.” 

Karasu tries to call Kazuaki thru his communications com implanted in his helmet. 

“Kaz… Kaaaazzzz.” Kazuaki wouldn’t answer.

Karasu Looks towards the gang member and begins to choke him with the steel wire again.

“I… I gave you all that you wanted.” The gangster pleaded

“Yes you did and I said that would get you a quick death.”

“Oh God!! What did I do to deserve this?”

“You HUNG out with the wrong crowd,” Karasu said as he threw the gangster out the window leaving him hanging from the steel wire outside the building.</p>

	<p>Wesley hurries back to his home to find it in flames. Police and fire trucks are all over the place. Wesley searches for a sign of Kazuaki, but he sees nothing. He deduces that Kazuaki must still be inside. Wesley flies inside the burning apartment complex. He searches the apartment to find Kazuaki with a long metal staff in sticking thru him. Wesley rushes over to Kazuaki’s side.

“Kazuaki we have to get out of here the place his falling apart.” Wesley says frantically as he tries to pick Kazuaki up.
“AAAAAHHHHH!!!” Kazuaki screams.

“That’s not going to work Wesley. I’m stuck here. You need to leave. Go after Han and his son. They’ve taken my suit. You… you need to stop them from causing more destruction and terror before it’s too late.” Kazuaki starts to slowly pass out.

“No. No. No. You can’t die now I still have so much to learn.” Wesley says with tears streaming down his eyes.

“You’re on your own now young Wesley. You are now the last defender.” Kazuaki says right before he passes away.</p>

<p>Filled with uncontrollable rage Wesley bursts out of the fire engulfed apartment. He flies for hours with no direction. He drops into an abandoned factory emotionally and physically exhausted. 

“WWWHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!” Wesley screams in agony as rain pours and lightning flashes. 

Wesley starts destroying everything around him. He wears himself out and passes out. He wakes up in the factory and tries to find more information on Han and his son. For a few nights Wesley went around as Karasu interrogating and torturing every criminal he could find in Hanzai Toshi. What Wesley didn’t know is that the suit was slowly taking over Wesley’s psyche because of his vulnerable state. Wesley eventually gets the answers he is looking for and heads off to confront Han. Wesley arrives at Han’s mansion later that night. Wesley dives thru a window and takes out three guards by cutting their heads clean off with his wings. A guard shoots at Karasu, but misses. Karasu snaps the guard’s neck and throws him over the railing.</p> 

<p>“What was that?” Kota asked his father

“This is the moment you and I have been waiting for. A chance to eradicate Bādosutairu for good.” Han said as he gives Kota a fully automatic machine gun.

“Light him up son”</p>

	<p>Kota starts shooting in Karasu’s direction and hits him in his shoulder. Karasu leaps over a concrete wall. Kota continues to unload into the wall. Karasu throws a knife at a fire sprinkler and releases water all over Kota. Karasu jumps over the throws a knife at a light bulb above Kota. The sparks on top of Kota and the water electrocuting him burning him to a crisp. Karasu finds his way to Han and is instantly shot in the chest with a shotgun. Karasu got the wind knocked out of him. Han starts tearing apart the suit before it has a chance to rebuild itself. Karasu is exposed for he really is Wesley Ezell a 22 -year old punk kid. 

“You’re just some kid. You’re the one who's been causing all this trouble. I’m going to have fun kicking your a** .” 

Han mounts Wesley and starts punching Wesley in the face mercisley. Wesley grabs a piece of glass and stabs Han in his ribs.  

“AAAAHHHH” Han screamed in agony.</p> 

<p>Wesley throws Han off him and begins stabbing him relentlessly. Wesley is no longer Wesley Ezell. The spirit of Karasu has taken him over. Turning him into a ruthless killer looking for one thing and one thing only JUSTICE!!!!

 	Karasu stands on the edge of a building with the blood of Han still dripping from his hand and monologues to himself.

“Watashi wa haisha to gaishutsu shita umare desuga eiyū to seigi no shōchō to shite shinudeshou. Watashi wa reivundakara, jibun no michi ni hairu hito o korosudarou.” (I was born a loser and an outcast but will die as a hero and symbol of justice. For I'm the Raven and will kill anyone who gets in my way.) Karasu says in a demonic voice as he flies off into the night.</p>
