<h1>Social</h1>
<img src="http://thexpatmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/document-428334_1280.jpg"/>
<p>Our society’s social structure built on a hierarchy that consists of a king, nobles, wealthy citizens, poor citizens, and the slaves/prisoners of war, similar to the hierarchy of Ancient Egypt. 1% of the population is the king and his family. 9% of the population are the nobles that advise the king based on the voice of the people. 20% of the population are wealthy citizens that work as artisans and merchants. 50% of the population are poor citizens that work as miners or soldiers. 20% of the population are slaves. Our civilization is monotheistic and believes in a God named Shalamba, similar to modern Christianity. We give great praise and follow the ways of our messiah Kennai, also similar to how modern-day Christianity believes in Jesus. Our people follow the laws and teachings of our god and king in order to achieve eternal life. Our king has nobles that represent the poor and rich citizens and tell him what changes they want to be done to the island. Our civilization follows the ancient Chinese philosophy of Legalism, meaning we have adhered to a strict formula of laws and punishments so that citizens are kept in check. Shalamba gave laws to the people of the island to follow, similar to the Ten Commandments.



You will not kill your fellow man 
You will respect and love your neighbor 
Do not steal from fellow citizens 
Live and die for your God and country 
Respect the authorities.
Never disrespect Shalamba. 

These are the laws Shalamba put in place, while some lesser laws were written by judges. If you break minor laws you will be flogged for 20 minutes. If you break the Creed of Shalamba, you will be hanged. If you break the 6th law of Shalamba, you are beaten and sent out to sea on a raft. When you are accused of a crime you are judged and prosecuted by nobles. All men serve in the military. for a period of 4 years in order to receive citizenship.</p>

<h1>Political</h1>
<p>Our islands are ruled by a monarchy, and we also believe in the philosophy of legalism. Our king is the executive power of our islands. Nobles come up with new laws, can judge and prosecute criminals, and make reports to the king about the people, similar to how nobles were advisers to the pharaoh in ancient Egypt. Our civilization only gives citizenship to those who are born on the island and serve in the military for 4 years, somewhat like the Agoge of Sparta. However, we do give business citizenships to individuals who bring trade to our civilization. Our major laws are:


You will not kill your fellow man.
You will respect and love your neighbor.
Do not steal from fellow citizens.
Live and die for your God and country.
Respect your authority.
Never disrespect Shalamba.

There are many other laws that have been written by nobles, but these laws are really based on the basic idea of right and wrong. Any crime can be brought to nobles, who will evaluate the situation and make a judgment based on these ideas. Ancient Egypt had a similar sort of system where nobles made judgments based on the basic idea of right and wrong. Our people have the right to express themselves as long as you don’t commit blasphemy or disrespect Shalamba in any way. Our people are responsible for our trade and the defense of the island. Civilians can talk to their local noble if they have an issue or complaint.</p>

<h1>Intellectual</h1>
<p>Our civilization is monotheistic. We believe in one god named Shalamba. The name of our religion is the Creed of Shalamba. Our king is our religious leader he is a descendant from our messiah Kennai. Our king is second when it comes to praising from the citizens. From trading and traveling the philosophy of legalism found its way to our civilization. The citizens believe that Shalamba placed strict laws over them so they don’t get out of control like their ancestors. In the summer we have a month long festival called Shamboree. Citizens celebrate Shalamba during this festival with lots of drinking and parties. Laws are less strict during these festivities. We also have Founder's day where citizens celebrate Kennai’s discovery of the islands by having a week long fast and daily prayer to Kennai and Shalamba.</p> 


<h1>Economics</h1>
<p>The jobs in our civilization are miners, merchants, artisans, and soldiers. Since we have a lot of iron in our civilization to trade with other territories. We get crops from trading with Territory 4. Other than that, we mainly eat fish from our rivers and hunt in our forests. We store half of the crops we earn from trade in the statue of Kennai in a case of crisis. The rest are sold in our marketplace. Our currency is based on the weight of our iron coins. We made a harbor so other territories can trade with us safely. We write on stone tablets. Part of our deal with Territory 4 is that our rich can go to their schools for a better education. Rich citizens usually have the job of merchant or artisan because of their higher education. Merchants are masters at trading and travel to different territories to trade for the islands. Poor citizens jobs are miners and soldiers. We tax the rich and poor for money, but we tax the poor less because they are the backbone of our society.</p>
